        <p class="p-msg">
            Are you planning on starting your own poultry egg hatching business? If yes, then Zekmos Hatchery is the answer. We manufacture small and medium-large scale commercial egg incubators ideal for entrepreneurs who want to start their own egg hatcheries.

            <div class="section-title">Why start a hatchery?</div>
            <p class="p-msg">
                It is a highly profitable business and your return on investment is very quick. The poultry industry is one of the fastest-growing sectors in the world, and Ghana is no exception. Chicken meat demand is growing so fast that farmers are unable to satisfy the market demand. Therefore, poultry production and business are the way to go.

            <div class="section-title">Do I need a lot of money to start a hatchery?</div>
            <p class="p-msg">
                No, you can start with very little money and generate an income within 3 weeks! Start with one or two incubators and buy more as your business grows. Zekmos Hatchery offers a full range of incubators and hatchers, from 100 chicks to 100,000 chicks per month!

            <p class="p-msg">
                You will need egg incubators and brooders. Incubators hatch the chicks, and brooders keep them warm after hatching. Contact us to discuss your specific hatchery needs.

            <div class="section-title">What facilities do I need?</div>
            <p class="p-msg">
                Our incubators and hatchers need to be stored indoors with good airflow and a temperature between 15 and 25 degrees Celsius. This ensures optimal functioning.

            <div class="section-title">How much space do I need?</div>
            <p class="p-msg">
                This depends on the size of your hatchery. We can help you determine the required space. Many customers use a spare room, garage, or shed for their incubators.

        <div class="interactive">
            <div class="section-title">Who do I sell my newly hatched chicks to?</div>
            <p class="p-msg">
                You will sell your day-old chicks to "growers" who rear the chicks to fully grown birds. You can find growers by searching the internet for people who sell chickens.

            <div class="section-title">How long does it take to start making money?</div>
            <p class="p-msg">
                You can start making money in as little as 3-4 weeks. Your first batch of chicks will hatch after 21 days, and you can sell them for profit immediately.
